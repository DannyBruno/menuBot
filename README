UMich Dining Hall Messenger Bot v1.0





What?
___________

(Still working out the kinks but..)
This is a Facebook Messenger chat bot designed to disseminate University of Michigan Dining Hall menus in a more digestable way. The bot has a short chat interface that allows user to subscribe and unsubscribe- given that a user chooses to subscribe they will be sent Dining Hall menus for their selected halls every morning, making it easy to wake up, check your phone, and plan your meals for the day. 

If you're a UMich student (or just curious), feel free to stop by and check it out:

How?
___________

The bot is written in Python, and uses a number of helpful libraries (Python-Flask, APScheduler, Python Requests primarily) to interface with Facebook's Graph and Messenger Send APIs.  



Why?
___________

The first thing I do every morning is do a quick scroll through of my phone. The time from then until I'm sitting at my chair in class could best be characterized as a typhoon of soap, clothes, toothpaste and water. The last thing want to spend time thinking about is what I'm going to do for food. I figured this may help.
